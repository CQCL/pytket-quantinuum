# Building the docs

The docs are built by using the [pytket-docs-theming](https://github.com/CQCL/pytket-docs-theming/) repository as a git submodule. If there are issues with the docs build, feel free to open an issue or pull request there.

For instructions on how to build the docs, take a look at the [extensions README](https://github.com/CQCL/pytket-docs-theming/blob/main/extensions/README.md).
