# # Ground-State Calculations with Chemically-Aware Unitary Coupled Cluster

# This notebook demonstrates a Hamiltonian Avaraging procedure for a 6-qubit  electronic structure chemistry problem on an H-Series device with the  Chemically-Aware Unitary Coupled Cluster (UCC) Ansatz.

# The aim is to estimate the energy of the $\textrm{CH}_4$ molecule. The Hamiltonian Averaging procedure is used to estimate this quantity.


# VQE uses Hamiltonian Averaging, aiming to optimise an initial  parameter set to obtain the lowest energy. In this use case, only one iteration of VQE is executed on  H-Series. The optimal parameters characterising the ground-state of $\textrm{CH}_4$ are obtained from  a noiseless statevector simulator on a classical computer - VQE is performed on a classical computer as  a pre-processing step. These parameters are substituted into the Chemically-Aware UCC circuit. This circuit is then combined with the measurement operations necessary to measure the $\textrm{CH}_4$ Hamiltonian and executed on hardware.

# To minimise the two-qubit gate resources, approximations are made to represent this molecule with 6-qubits. The Chemically Aware UCC Ansatz can be defined with both arbitrary-angle two-qubit gates and fixed-angle two-qubit gates. With arbitrary-angle two-qubit gates, a higher quality output is
# expected.

Capabilities include, but are not limited to, ground-state and excited-state calculations with the proprietary Chemically-Aware UCC method, additional productivity tools to improve result quality, and resource cost for calculations on H-Series.

# The $\textrm{CH}_4$ problem was simulated on H-series to estimate (1) optical spectra and (2) a chemical reaction to remove $\textrm{CH}_4$, a greenhouse gas from the atmosphere [Link](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-abstract/158/21/214114/2893956/Chemically-aware-unitary-coupled-cluster-with-ab?redirectedFrom=fulltext).

# ## Hamiltonian Specification
# First we load in a 6-qubit $\textrm{CH}_4$ Hamiltonian from the `data` subdirectory. The Hamiltonian data is stored in a `json` file. This is loaded into the `QubitPauliOperator` instance using the class method `from_list`.

# This Hamiltonian is generated using InQuanto. For more information, please contact <inquanto-support@quantinuum.com>.

# ## Chemically-Aware UCC Circuit with Fixed-Angle Two-Qubit Gates
# The Chemically-Aware UCC state-preparation method for this $\textrm{CH}_4$ consists of applying exponentiated Qubit Pauli operations to a reference input state. Our input state is $| 100000 \rangle$. The aim is to generate the parameteric wavefunction,

# \begin{equation*}
# |\psi\rangle = |110000\rangle + \alpha |001100\rangle + \beta |000011\rangle,
# \end{equation*}

# where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are related to gate angles on the state-preparation circuit.

# In this problem, four operations are applied, the top equation first and the bottom equation last,

# \begin{align*}
# e^{+\theta_0 \frac{\pi}{2} \hat{Y}_{q[0]} \hat{X}_{q[2]}}, \\
# e^{-\theta_0 \frac{\pi}{2} \hat{X}_{q[0]} \hat{Y}_{q[2]}}, \\
# e^{+\theta_1 \frac{\pi}{2} \hat{Y}_{q[0]} \hat{X}_{q[4]}}, \\
# e^{-\theta_1 \frac{\pi}{2} \hat{X}_{q[0]} \hat{Y}_{q[4]}}.
# \end{align*}

# This will generate the state, $|100000\rangle + \alpha |001000\rangle + \beta |000010\rangle$. Subsequently, three `CX` gates can be applied to generate the final target state, $|\psi\rangle$.

# This operation can be seen as exciting a pair of electrons from the least energetic spatial orbital to a higher energy spatial orbital. In  this problem, we have three spatial orbitals: one double occupied orbital, and two unoccupied or virtual orbitals. Each even-odd qubit pair  in the circuit corresponds to the spatial orbitals. Each spatial orbital consists of alpha (beta) spin orbitals or spin-up (spin-down) spin-orbitals. If the orbital is occupied, the qubit is toggled to a $|1\rangle$ ($|0\rangle$), the spin-orbital is occupied (unoccupied).

# InQuanto provides the Chemically Aware UCC method which can be used to synthesise pytket circuits for electronic structure problems involving single excitations, double excitations, including double excitations of pairs of electrons from spatial orbital to spatial orbital. Additionally, InQuanto uses system specific data, such as point-group symmetry, to improve the number of single and double excitations to synthesise in the state-preparation method.

# In the code cell below, the function generates the subcircuit for the  exponentiated operations. For the case of two spatial to spatial double excitations, 4 primitives are required with two symbols, $a$ and $b$. These primitives are returned as `pytket.circuit.CircBox` objects which can be appended onto the `pytket.circuit.Circuit` state-preparation instance.

# The primitive defined below is know as the Pauli-gadget primitive. For spatial to spatial double excitations, each Pauli-Gadget requires two `CX` gates.

# ## Chemically-Aware Unitary Coupled Cluster Circuit with Fixed-Angle Two-Qubit Gates synthesised with `pytket` `PauliExpBox`
# The Chemically-Aware UCC circuit from the previous section can also be synthesised with `PauliExpBox` and `CircBox`. The motivation is to perform [Pauli-Gadget Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01734) to synthesise the UCC state-preparation circuit. The benefit is that the circuit primitives from the previous section are now automatically created with `pytket` and there are additional savings in fixed-angle two-qubit gates. The user is required to input the Qubit Pauli exponents as a sequence of Paulis (`List[pytket.pauli.Pauli]`) alongside a symbolic parameter.

# Each spatial to spatial excitation consists of two exponeniated operations. In the code cell below, this would correspond to two `PauliExpBox` instances with the same symbolic parameter. Each pair of `PauliExpBox` instances belonging to the same excitation is appended to a `pytket.circuit.Circuit` instance and isolated with a `pytket.circuit.CircBox`.

The latter compilation pass optimises the number of fixed-angle two-qubit gates on the circuit.

# ## Chemically-Aware UCC Circuit with Arbitrary-Angle Two-Qubit Gates
# The circuits defined above used fixed-angle two-qubit (`CX`) gates. Compiling to the H-Series gateset results in circuits with `pytket.ciruit.OpType.ZZMax` or fully-entangling two-qubit gates.

# In this section, the Chemically-Aware UCC circuit is defined at 6-qubits with an  arbitrary-angle two-qubit gate (`pytket.circuit.OpType.ZZPhase`). This arbitrary-angle  two-qubit gate is a native gate on H-Series and for small angles, offers better fidelity than  the native fixed-angle two-qubit gate.

# In the code cell below, a function is defined, requiring a symbol and a boolean as input. The  symbol is the gate angle for the arbitrary-phase two-qubit gate. The boolean keyword argument  dictates whether to synthesise $e^{\theta Y_{q[0]} X_{q[1]}}$ or $e^{\theta X_{q[0]} Y_{q[1]}}$. The output of this function is a `pytket.circuit.CircBox`. As with the previous section, 2 excitations are synthesised, each excitation requiring 2 `pytket.circuit.CircBox` instances.

# ## Classical Noiseless Variational Procedure with NumPy and SciPy

The `pytket.circuit.Circuit` instance can be represented as a complex column vector with $2^N$ elements ($N$ is the number of qubits - for this problem the vector will contain 64 elements). The objective function performs these transformations and evaluates the energy using the numpy dot product function.

# * a `QuantinuumBackend` instance
# * an integer specifying the number of shots to execute per circuit

# * a boolean specifying whether the circuit should be rebased from `ZZPhase` (after compilation by QuantinuumBackend) to `ZZMax`

# This function prepares the measurement circuits needed to perform Hamiltonian Averaging. First the Hamiltonian is decomposed into commuting sets of Pauli-strings. Second, the commuting sets are synthesised into measurement operations, which are appended onto a copy of the Chemically-Aware UCC circuit (with numerical parameters). The circuits are submitted under the same batch session.

# A second function, `hamiltonian_averaging_evaluate`, retrieves the result and performs the appropriate post-processing to evaluate the expectation value of the Hamiltonian. If the parameters corresponding to the approximate ground-state are inputted into `hamiltonian_averaging_submission`, then the approximate ground-state energy is evaluated.

# The Jensen-Shannon divergence is a metric to estimate the similarity between two probability distributions. Output from the three experiments on the H-Series emulator are compared to the output from the noiseless emulator calculation. During the Hamiltonian Averaging procedure, distributions of measurement outcomes are calculated. These distributions are processed to estimate the expectation value of the Hamiltonian. In the code-cell below, these distributions are retrieved using `QuantinuumBackend`.
