    "Quantinuum offers a real-time hybrid compute capability for Quantum Error Correction (QEC) workflows. This capability executes [Web Assembly (Wasm)](https://webassembly.org/) in the H-Series stack and enables use of libraries (e.g. linear algebra and graph algorithms) and complex datastructures (e.g. vectors and graphs) during real-time execution of a quantum circuit. Unlocking experimentation of basic QEC workflows is an important milestone, as Quantinuum plans to upgrades its H-Series hardware and deploy practical QEC schemes at scale. Wasm has been used, previously, in quantum error correction schemes [[arxiv.2208.01863](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01863), [arxiv.2305.03828](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03828)]. Syndrome measurement results are sent to a classical computer where a decoding algorithm is used to determine recovery operations and update quantum circuits in real-time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Wasm is a binary instruction format. To compile Wasm binaries, a low-level programming language, such as Rust or C/ C++, is used to compose desired classical functions before compilation. The quantum computing workflow will then contain a call to Wasm. The folder this notebooks is in contains examples of this workflow. Wasm is used because it is a fast, safe, expressive, and easy to compile with familiar programming languages.\n",

Additional guidance is also provided on compiling Wasm binaries from Rust or C/C++ source. *[Basic Usage](#Basic-Usage)* details using TKET capabilities to link the Wasm module to a TKET circuit as well as submission to H-Series. The *[Repetition Code](#Repetition-Code)* section narrates how the Wasm feature can be used to enable a decoder-style lookup table in the Repetition code workflow.\n",

    "    * Examples of the types of functions that can be put into code are provided in the `c/src` or `rust/src` folders within each of the example folders.\n",
    "    * The function to compile to Wasm must accept multiple integers and return exactly one integer.\n",

    "    * C source code cannot use the C standard library, WASI is needed for this, which breaks the Wasm memory sandbox.\n",

    "        * Random number generation\n",
    "        * File I/O\n",
    "        * Exception Handling\n",
    "1. Quantum programs can call two types of Wasm functions:\n",
    "    * Void Wasm functions, e.g. to initialize the Wasm environment.\n",
    "    * Wasm functions that accept multiple (>=0) integers and return one or none integer. For example, examine the call `x = wasm_func(a, b, c);` The `wasm_func` function can exist in QASM where `a`, `b`, `c` and `x` are classical registers. Such function calls have timing restrictions. Wasm calls in quantum programs have required multiple milliseconds.\n",
    "1. The state of a Wasm program persists between calls in the quantum programs within the limits of a job chunk window (~300 shots). \n",
    "    * This means global variables can hold a mutable state that is modified between calls.\n",
    "    * One can imagine using various global arrays. It's possible to have global pointers work with heap allocated data structures (for example using unsafe Rust features when compiling to Wasm).\n",
